This code is an implementation of known-plaintext-attack on Cellular Mobile Encryption Algorithm (CMEA). 
This is Level-2 problem on Mystery Twister. https://www.mysterytwisterc3.org/en/challenges/level-ii/cmea-1
This problem was solved by approximately 1000 people when we solved it. 


For solving this problem we used 2 resources: 
1. A paper: https://www.schneier.com/academic/paperfiles/paper-cmea.pdf
2. Powerpoint slides: http://www.cs.sjsu.edu/~stamp/crypto/PowerPoint_PDF/11_CMEA.pdf

I think these two resources are good enough to solve this problem.
